Developing is a hard task, and doing it correctly is even harder. But
I have to admit it's fun, really fun, otherwise I wouldn't have stared my
blog. Here I share my open source projects, tools I build over the time
and that can be useful to others, just to not let them die as bits in my
hard drive !

## About me

I started as a Developer and now I'm more and more involved in project
management, software Design and architecture, rather than write actual
code. In order to keep my brain still in order I really do need to do some
programming, so in my (rare!) spare time, between the job of being
a father, and a job that lets me face new challenges every day, I try to
blog about C/C++, Software Design, Algorithms. 

Anyway, just skip to the [real stuff](/posts), don't waste your time on
this page !
